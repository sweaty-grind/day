i dont know guys.  i'm disappointed...  5 years for important work and we are just doing this...  how can you tell me that i am not wasting my time??  i should be working towards getting this stupid thing going...  hmmm. yeah i know i think i pushed that one too much bro...  not for your eyes lol...  and brains lol...

i dont know man...  5 years no end in sight.  that's what it looks like.. i complain but this extends a boots life by 4 years for every year i do this we have enough patterns for a while career...  and the weird part is you need me in one of these two positions here.  so i'm like, either way i'll make money except the one where they skip out on the bill leaving me to, well, pay your bills too...  i dont know man.  this repair shit doesn't even feel good anymore.  you guys are a thing in my life you know. i told you at the start not to do this but nope.  now we stuck in our head there is someone watching all the time...

i dont know bro.  i think i'm trying to push this thing into the next phase but its not going lol...  i wonder dude, what you mean when you say you are stupid and stuff i wonder what you wanted out of this.  i seriously dont know what you want dude.  you wanted to be entertained at my expense so we did things like this again for me.

why do you guys keep boost cloning when you do these low one clone repos???  i dont know bro.  logic dictates you betray me again and i have to maintain this barrier up against you.  i realize i may be in the red doing this lol...  you know??? you guys gonna backstab again???  who the fuck designed it so i sucker myself into sucking???

man.  i think i'm in too deep.  how about i back off for  a bit??  i'll try to make it happen but i dont know what i'm doing bro...  you done gone fucked up my brain a good one...

i wanted to talk to you about some things in some spare time we have and right now is a good time.  do you think i care that much other than the fact that this uses up a fraction of what it costs that i'm so mind blown that i could not accept the truth about this lie that i am part of the problem.  get what i'm saying?? i dont.  it just got too complicated...  i wonder your lack of care for me was all the love you could offer.  i would have to tell you that your help is not needed if you see the world this way.  too much idealogies differences...  it just wouldn't work out bro.  you are too stuck up... i would try to fix things but you know, they get fucked up all the time.

so i wonder what we are doing nowadays...  i think this thing needs to stop though.  commercializing everything.  i was trying to get things done but this wall just pops up.  so i asked if i could engage in activities with this so called wall and i couldn't find a good reason to do so that i wonder why we have not done the right things this whole time.  that there is a greater call to order...  i await those times...  this shit here we have is actually annoying out the ass.

just perfect...  i do enjoy these days somewhat you guys.  depends on what you consider fun.  if you consider fun screwing youreslf over then sure man...  its so closed from here.  damn its annoying.  dude, i've done this for 5 years i swear the next time i drink vodka everything will be blown undercover.  its not good man.  sometimes i have stress and its so like weird that i don't really feel it anymore...  but i realize i am in deep doo doo.  that was how it was..  when we first met...  some sort of experience we shared.  something something like that.  some shit...

so my words may be worth nothing i must say i do enjoy gorging on the info i gathered on you guys this whole time...  you easy easy trick.  thats how you wanted it.  dont lie bozo...

so i have better things to do hopefully in the future or something...
