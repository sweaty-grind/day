# day

i figured it out now.  i enjoy this insanity.  my brain going whacko and thsi insanity is going good...  yeah yeah tough work.  from my pov guys...  its like shit i forgot damn topomax.  sharkey has a field day with that.  chooses what he wants me to remember and then justifies it with this dumb mind loss topamax.  i think its worn out its purposes...

oh yeah i claim 5 years work with you so far and nothing payment for another 3 years i wonder bro... i killed your asses many times over and we are still doing this.  that you never progressed under the name of progression.  and i took advantage of it cause you did too.  so stop whining lol...  i have never met such up tight people doing malicious damage to my sanity like this...  you're not even supposed to be real...  but honestly this work is fairly easy.  its hard when you don't know what you're doing or after and you have pre conditions that prevent you from thinking clearly...  my mind is so shrouded i already know it just i couldn't even pick my brain cells back to life.

anyways... i dont know.  easy game easy life.  just the perks can be nightmares to get.  that i should be thankful for what i have i just wondered why i lost some when i could fix some.  things you could be doing while you are able to do them but some guy stops it.  i still have steam for programming you know...  but this dumb fuck brain plug shit ain't working.  i feel these are caused by you but apparently its a thing that it fucks up your head.  so i think we need to get rid of it...
