i dont know guys.  i'm disappointed...  5 years for important work and we are just doing this...  how can you tell me that i am not wasting my time??  i should be working towards getting this stupid thing going...  hmmm. yeah i know i think i pushed that one too much bro...  not for your eyes lol...  and brains lol...

i dont know man...  5 years no end in sight.  that's what it looks like.. i complain but this extends a boots life by 4 years for every year i do this we have enough patterns for a while career...  and the weird part is you need me in one of these two positions here.  so i'm like, either way i'll make money except the one where they skip out on the bill leaving me to, well, pay your bills too...  i dont know man.  this repair shit doesn't even feel good anymore.  you guys are a thing in my life you know. i told you at the start not to do this but nope.  now we stuck in our head there is someone watching all the time...

i dont know bro.  i think i'm trying to push this thing into the next phase but its not going lol...  i wonder dude, what you mean when you say you are stupid and stuff i wonder what you wanted out of this.  i seriously dont know what you want dude.  you wanted to be entertained at my expense so we did things like this again for me.
