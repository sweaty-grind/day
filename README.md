# day

every day we do this...  i feel like the days are moving too fast for me...

lets try to play cipher okay???  i used to think it was cool and i was laying class warfare with you but then we just hit this thing and you can see exactly the reason why i dont punish your asses.  it was always built upon the dream doctrine.  you left me in a dream.  i have to thank you for that...  something something lousy...

yeah so i dont like hate you for all the time i wasted. i hate you for wasting the conclusion of that time in my life.  we skipped everything you buffoon.  i'm too old for a new career.  i used to be powerful mess now i am stupid mess.  i dont hate you for any of this bro.  i can see your position and i wouldn't blame you for it.  cause you're that kind of person lol... i met a thousand times before lol.  

so i mean, why are we doing this thing?? i wonder dude.  this shark has played too hard of a game i could not handle it.  nothing really lol...  no i am perfectly fine and don't need your help.  at this point drowning in the rapids is a real prospect. i can't catch up to my mind dude.  it makes it hard to focus.  sharkey specializes in it so much i gave up fighting him for it unless its something i can powerhouse through...

so you came here and you did a thing that took up everybody's time and we are no closer to solving the problem of your world is dying you buffoon.  i told you we need to make deadlines idiot.  there must be another signal or some shit to end this crap.  i swear i put the fear of dickens in you.  why you not go away??? i never understood some of these complaints.  i was just whining lol...  could you tell though??  i have the panel repo up still...

so you know when we start using the ... things get a little slower here.  more defined...  cause we can't do better for some reason...  our mind has not been able to do what it needed to do to survive. i just been artificially alive.  this shark put the fear of homelessness in me.  i think i need to end him... you know???

so this war was always fought against the shark.  at the end of the day...  you must see it this way.  you bask in his cheat codes i dont know why you don't offer it back.   lousy lol...

i'm tired. this game in the millions has too many fragile players.  sharkey is fragile too.  my ass is too. your ass all the time...  i wonder what you wanted from me sometimes...  we shouldn't be doing this i say.  you say we need more info. i tell you some crap.  you come back with more crap for me to learn.  and we all go round in a giant circle or what.

so yeah we played million dollar slot machine.  sigh.  i wonder dude.  we do this thing with you you act like a cheapskate we can't move forward at all.  bask in the glory of the uniclops...  something like that.  it was fun...

why do i get monees this way?? a tradeoff for another tradeoff by the time it gets to me.  at which point i wouldn't need your services anyways...  so it is what it is...

i'm tired.  drank 4 monsters.  can't process much on here any more. i think my brain fatigued...  this is tiring bro. i can't handle your stupid oh la la secret plate shit okay???  sometimes i wonder you guys...  that uneven and unpaid debts makes you a worse character than not.  then i read some more and realized you did pay your dues.  and why do i still sit here like this with this mindset???  oh wait you literally are when the wall hits reality or reality hits the wall...

could it be??  though...  that i am suffering because i am pressing myself too much...  i can't help but notice i could have helped something out but we dont do that and i wanted a job and we dont do that either.
